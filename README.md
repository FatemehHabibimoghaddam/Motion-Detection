This project aims to create an application for real time motion detection using surveillance camera. The project is based on Python and OpenCV. Whenever the motion is detected, it starts recording. If the size of the moving object is greater than 0.2 resolution of the frames, the application notifies the administrator by gmail. The current file was prepared for presentation. Therefore, you can learn motion detection step by step. At the end of this file you can find the final code.
